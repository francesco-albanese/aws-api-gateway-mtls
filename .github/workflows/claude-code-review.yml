            Review this PR but don't do a recap of the changes done, there's already
            the diff for that. Focus on the code changes.
            Be extremely concise — terse bullet points only.

            Rules:
            - Only flag real bugs, security issues, or performance problems
            - No praise, no filler, no minor style suggestions
            - Each bullet: file:line — issue description
            - Skip if nothing significant found — comment "LGTM" only
            - Use CLAUDE.md for project conventions

            Use `gh pr comment` to post your review.
